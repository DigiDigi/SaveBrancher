# SaveBrancher
A graphical utility for a tree-based storage/usage of save game files. (Written for Linux but could easily be modded.)

It generates an SBR folder where it stores any number of saves along with an .sbr file to save positioning and node links.
Loading saves is attached to a script that launches xdotool and loads the save from within a game or emulator with a hotkey.

Here's an example with Romancing SaGa 3 savestates:
